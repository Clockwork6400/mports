When upgrading, there is a known bug with this port that it doesn't
clean up after the old version.  If you have errors running meson,
remove the old directory. 

replace with the default python version you are using and the version 
number of the old meson release.

rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/meson-0.63.1-py3.8.egg-info/
